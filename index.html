<h7>The History of Pong</h7>

<p>Pong was made by the company Atari which was a big stapel in retro gaming. 
    Don't get me wrong Atari is amazing but if you dive deeper into Pong's creation you cans see that it was mainly coded by two men who fought over the ownership of Atari and one ended ups leaving.
     These men were Ted Dabney and Nolan Bushnell I will give biographys on the two. </p>
<p13>Ted Dabney</p13>
<br>
<p11>Dabney was the main coder of the game and wa the one who left after the fight. Dabney died in 2018 and Bushnell takes full credit for pong and Atari.</p11>
<br>
<h8>Nolan Bushnell</h8>
<br>
<p12>Bushnell is the current owner of Atari he is still alive to this day managing the company. He stayed after the fought with Dabney. But he helped code less of pong which is probably one of the reasons fights were started.</p12>
